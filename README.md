# SaveLoadSystem
 
Hierarchical data save-load system for Unity that [supports various data types](https://github.com/ozantekce/SaveLoadSystem/blob/main/Assets/SaveLoadSystem/Core/SupportedDataTypes.cs). A SavableData object can be serialized in different ways, including [custom serialization](https://github.com/ozantekce/SaveLoadSystem/blob/main/Assets/SaveLoadSystem/Core/SaveStrategy/CustomSerializeSaveStrategy.cs), [JSON](https://github.com/ozantekce/SaveLoadSystem/blob/main/Assets/SaveLoadSystem/Core/SaveStrategy/JsonSaveStrategy.cs), and [.NET serialization](https://github.com/ozantekce/SaveLoadSystem/blob/main/Assets/SaveLoadSystem/Core/SaveStrategy/SerializeSaveStrategy.cs). Additionally, save-load system supports several encryption methods, which are sufficient for non-sensitive data. It also includes asynchronous saving and loading capabilities.
